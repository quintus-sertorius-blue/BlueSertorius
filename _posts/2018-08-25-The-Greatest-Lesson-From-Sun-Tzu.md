![Sun Tzu is not pleased.](https://aforisticamente.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SunTzu1.jpg)


Honesty is considered a good quality. However, in real life, honest people are not that appreciated. Think about the three people that you *like* the most. 

Seriously, try it.

Now the three people that you *hate* the most.

**Do you see?**

I can tell you because I used to be one of them. People would tell me how *moral* I was, being honest. Even though, deep in their mind, **they would hate me.** The fault was on me: I was trying to communicate with everybody.. 

A little secret: the world is divided between *those who get it and those who do not.*

- Being open to everybody means you lose time and sanity each time you discuss with people who will not try to understand the point. Instead, they will use it to attack you.

- Being open to everbody means you give away free information. I do not have to explain you why it is *very* bad.

- Being open to everybody means **you are just lazy**, as you refuse to accept reality and play the game.

Yes, life is war, but wars do not need to be won with brute force. The greatest victory is to win without *even fighting*.
